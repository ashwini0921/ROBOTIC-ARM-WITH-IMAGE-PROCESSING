# ROBOTIC-ARM-WITH-IMAGE-PROCESSING
Designed robotic Arm which can separate fruits using Deep Learning

## ABSTRACT

The project involves the development of a 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm capable of fruit separation through image processing techniques. A classification model is designed using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to accurately identify and categorize fruits based on their size, shape, and color attributes. This innovative approach combines robotics and artificial intelligence to enhance fruit sorting processes, contributing to efficiency and precision in agricultural and food industries. The integration of image processing and machine learning underscores the potential for automated fruit handling, optimizing quality control and streamlining production workflows.
